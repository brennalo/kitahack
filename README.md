### note
i got the gradle issue and stuff and i decided to upgrade my android sdk version of my previous file idk what i was thinking ahahhahaa so it came up with more issues. so i open a new file just to complete the interface first, so i dont push whole thing to here la, just the files i have created and change.

for tien tien:
- the assets folder is just the pictures in case for debugging, but since you connect to firebase should be no need la
- the pubspec yaml, dont need download can just use your own file one, i just attached for reference to see what dependencies i add. i added "camera:" then pub get it will automatically get the latest version for you

for charlotte:
- the camera is working but since we're on virtual device so you might see a lot of grey and black boxes, you can try connect to a real device to test the camera out
